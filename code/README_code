Code is ordered within subanalyses

Neighborhood-level analyses should be run before individual-level ones (the individual-level part calls a temp file created by Tidycensus in the nhood code)

I've moved helper functions out of my personal package (like some wrappers for Tidycensus, etc) into the "misc" folder. That also includes the code that makes the big regression tables
